# CIFAR-10 Image Separation

**Goal:** Train a neural network to separate and classify blended images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

**Problem:**  
Each input image is generated by taking the **average of two random CIFAR-10 images**.  
- The **first image** comes from the first 5 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer.  
- The **second image** comes from the remaining 5 categories: dog, frog, horse, ship, truck.  

The model predicts **two labels**, one for each component image.  
The accuracy is computed for both predictions and **averaged**. Evaluation is done on **10,000 test images**.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Matplotlib  

**Results:**  
- Final model accuracy: ~74%
